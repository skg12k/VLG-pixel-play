# Animal Image Classification using Transfer Learning (ResNet50)
This repository contains a deep learning model that classifies animal images into one of 40 predefined classes. The model leverages transfer learning using the ResNet50 architecture, pretrained on ImageNet, and fine-tuned to adapt to the animal classification task. The model uses image preprocessing, data augmentation, and optimization techniques to improve accuracy and generalization.

# Overview
The primary goal of this project was to create an efficient image classification model capable of identifying various animals based on their visual features. The project involved:

Preprocessing the dataset for consistency and augmentation, Leveraging transfer learning to use a pretrained ResNet50 model, Fine-tuning the model for the animal classification task.
